What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

    Safety and Security
    Clarity
    Approachability
    Developer Experience
    Resource Oriented Programming

In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

    Of course safety ad security are always top priority bc people value the rights and property.

    Clarity is important to allow other to easily understand and work on your code, code that only you understand limits the development of your code, because then only you can contribute.

    Approachability allows for devs to quickly pickup on a language. Shortening the learning process allows removes a barrier to entry and allows for a growing community, in hopes to make the project a standard.

    Dev Exp: Devs like easy to debug and understand languages. A balance of control, yet not too much typing is always ideal.
