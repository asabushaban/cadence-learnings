Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.

-- a blockchain is a distributed network where information can be stored publicly. Users can interact with that information without restriction from centralized authorities. Blockchains typically have certain properties to protect users from scams and fordgery. Inheritly, blockchains allow for users to rely on distributed programming consensus (Math) instead of trusted (centralized) third parties, without compromosing security.

Explain what a Smart Contract is.

--a smart contract is logic deployed to the blockchain that allows users to change the state of data stored on the blockchain.

Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

-- a script allows a user to read information on of the blockchain while a transaction allows users to create, update, or delete information on the blockchain. A transaction typically has fees associated with its execution in the form of the blockchains native token. These "gas fees" serve as an incentive to the validators who mantain the integrity of the network.
