## Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.

a blockchain is a distributed network where information can be stored publicly. Users can interact with that information without restriction from centralized authorities. Blockchains typically have certain properties to protect users from scams and fordgery. Inheritly, blockchains allow for users to rely on distributed programming consensus (Math) instead of trusted (centralized) third parties, without compromosing security.

## Explain what a Smart Contract is.

a smart contract is logic deployed to the blockchain that allows users to change the state of data stored on the blockchain.

## Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

a script allows a user to read information on of the blockchain while a transaction allows users to create, update, or delete information on the blockchain. A transaction typically has fees associated with its execution in the form of the blockchains native token. These "gas fees" serve as an incentive to the validators who mantain the integrity of the network.

## What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

    Safety and Security
    Clarity
    Approachability
    Developer Experience
    Resource Oriented Programming

## In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

    Of course safety ad security are always top priority bc people value the rights and property.

    Clarity is important to allow other to easily understand and work on your code, code that only you understand limits the development of your code, because then only you can contribute.

    Approachability allows for devs to quickly pickup on a language. Shortening the learning process allows removes a barrier to entry and allows for a growing community, in hopes to make the project a standard.

    Dev Exp: Devs like easy to debug and understand languages. A balance of control, yet not too much typing is always ideal.
